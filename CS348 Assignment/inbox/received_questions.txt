The objective of this assignment is to develop a peer-to-peer file transfer application, comprising one manager
and multiple peers.
1. Manager
(i) A manager is an always-ON server, which maintains the list of currently active peers across the network at
all times [1 mark].
(ii) A newly arrived peer connects to the manager
a) [1 mark] The manager adds this newly arrived peer to its list of active peers, and,
b) [1 mark] broadcasts the updated list.
(iii) The manager periodically:
a) [1 mark] checks availability of active peers from its list,
b) [1 mark] updates the same, if some peer(s) leave(s) the network, and,
c) [1 mark] broadcasts the updated list.
(iv) A peer informs the manager when it leaves the network
a) [1 mark] The manager deletes this peer from its list of active peers, and,
b) [1 mark] broadcasts the updated list.
2. Peer
(i) A new peer is expected to know the managerâ€™s IP and port. It pings the manager [1 mark], and saves the list
of active peers sent by the manager [1 mark].
(ii) It also maintains a list of shareable files [1 mark].
(iii) Before going offline, a peer informs the manager [1 mark].
